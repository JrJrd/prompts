A class in JavaScript is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the properties and methods that an object will have.

Here is an example of a class in JavaScript:

class Car {
  constructor(make, model, year) {
    this.make = make;
    this.model = model;
    this.year = year;
  }

  drive() {
    console.log("The car is driving");
  }
}
